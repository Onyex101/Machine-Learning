## Project Description
Practical use of AI in the medical sector in form of disease diagnosis with medical imaging. Improve speed and accuracy of detecting brain tumors based on MRI scans in order to reduce the cost of cancer diagnosis and help in early diagnosis of tumors. the dataset consists of 3900 brain MRI scans along with their brain tumor locations. Two models were developed, the first model detects if a tumor exists in the brain MRI scan, if a tumor exists, the image is fed to a segmentation ResUnet model which localises and segments the tumor.

### Methods Used
