## Project Description
The system automatically monitors people's facial expressions. 20,000+ images with their associated facial expression labels and 2000+ images with facial keypoints annotations. two deep Neural Networks (DNN) were developed and deployed. The first model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual blocks to predict facial keypoints, The second DNN model classifies people's emotions such as anger, disgust, happiness, sadness and suprise.
